                    <h2>David Rivas</h2>
                    <h3>Research Assistant</h3>
                    <p>David graduated from Penn State University in 2019 with a B.S. in Biology. He joined the Muhle lab in December 2019 and has since been working as a research assistant. His roles include conducting animal behavior, histology, and laboratory/mouse colony management. Specifically, his work is focused on characterizing the behavior phenotype and associated brain circuitry of Chd8 haploinsufficient mice. When David is not in the lab or mouse room, he enjoys taking portrait photography, producing electronic music, and learning web development.
