                        <h3>Principal Investigator</h3>
                        <p>Dr. Muhle earned her medical and graduate degrees
                        from the Medical Scientist Training Program at the
                        Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and completed her
                        adult psychiatry residency and child & adolescent
                        fellowship training within the Solnit Integrated Adult
                        and Child & Adolescent Psychiatry Research Training
                        Program at the Yale University Child Study Center. Dr.
                        Muhle's scientific research aims to uncover molecular
                        genetic pathways that increase the likelihood of
                        neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, by
                        utilizing high-throughput genomics methods in mouse and
                        human model systems to examine the effects of
                        disruptions of implicated genes. She is a
                        board-certified general and child & adolescent
                        psychiatrist. When not in the clinic or the lab, she
                        enjoys concerts, playing fetch with the dog and
                        “fishing” with the cat.

                        <h3>Lab Manager</h3>
                        <p>David graduated from Penn State University in 2019 with a B.S. in Biology. He joined the Muhle lab in December 2019 as a research assistant and was promoted to Lab Manager in 2022. His roles include conducting animal behavior, histology, and laboratory/mouse colony management. Specifically, his work is focused on characterizing the behavior phenotype and associated brain circuitry of <i>Chd8</i><sup>+/-</sup> mice. When David is not in the lab or mouse room, he enjoys taking portrait photography, producing electronic music, and learning web development.
