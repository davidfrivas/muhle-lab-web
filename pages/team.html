                    <h2>Rebecca Muhle, M.D., Ph.D.</h2>
                    <h3>Principal Investigator</h3>
                    <p>Dr. Muhle earned her medical and graduate degrees from the Medical Scientist Training Program at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and completed her adult psychiatry residency and child & adolescent fellowship training within the Solnit Integrated Adult and Child & Adolescent Psychiatry Research Training Program at the Yale University Child Study Center. Dr. Muhle's scientific research aims to uncover molecular genetic pathways that increase risk for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, by utilizing high-throughput genomics methods in mouse and human model systems to examine the effects of disruptions of implicated risk genes. She is a board-certified general and child & adolescent psychiatrist. When not in the clinic or the lab, she attends rock concerts, and playing fetch with the dog and “fishing” with the cat.

                    <h2>David Rivas</h2>
                    <h3>Research Assistant</h3>
                    <p>David graduated from Penn State University in 2019 with a B.S. in Biology. He joined the Muhle lab in December 2019 and has since been working as a research assistant. His roles include conducting animal behavior, histology, and laboratory/mouse colony management. Specifically, his work is focused on characterizing the behavior phenotype and associated brain circuitry of <em>Chd8</em><sup>+/-</sup> mice. When David is not in the lab or mouse room, he enjoys taking portrait photography, producing electronic music, and learning web development.

                    <h3>Undergraduate Researcher</h3>
                    <p>Mahdia is a senior at Barnard College studying
                    Neuroscience and Behavior. In Fall 2021, she joined the
                    Muhle lab where she is performing behavior experiments and using immunohistochemistry to study the brain circuitry of
                    <em>Chd8</em><sup>+/-</sup> mice. In her free time, Mahdia enjoys exploring nature/restaurants, learning Bollywood dances, and cooking.
