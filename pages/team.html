                        <h3>Principal Investigator</h3>
                        <p>Dr. Muhle earned her medical and graduate degrees from the Medical Scientist Training Program at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and completed her adult psychiatry residency and child & adolescent fellowship training within the Solnit Integrated Adult and Child & Adolescent Psychiatry Research Training Program at the Yale University Child Study Center. Dr. Muhle's scientific research aims to uncover molecular genetic pathways that increase risk for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, by utilizing high-throughput genomics methods in mouse and human model systems to examine the effects of disruptions of implicated risk genes. She is a board-certified general and child & adolescent psychiatrist. When not in the clinic or the lab, she attends rock concerts, and playing fetch with the dog and “fishing” with the cat.

                        <h3>Research Assistant</h3>
                        <p>David graduated from Penn State University in 2019 with a B.S. in Biology. He joined the Muhle lab in December 2019 and has since been working as a research assistant. His roles include conducting animal behavior, histology, and laboratory/mouse colony management. Specifically, his work is focused on characterizing the behavior phenotype and associated brain circuitry of <i>Chd8</i><sup>+/-</sup> mice. When David is not in the lab or mouse room, he enjoys taking portrait photography, producing electronic music, and learning web development.

                        <p>Sam is a senior at Barnard College majoring in
                        Neuroscience and Behavior and minoring in Science and
                        Public Policy. She joined the Muhle lab in 2021 and is currently
                        working on her senior thesis. Additionally, she has
                        since completed the Barnard Summer Research Institute
                        twice. Her roles include mouse
                        behavior and data analysis using Python. When Sam is not in the
                        lab she enjoys going on runs and exploring new places in
