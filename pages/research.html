            <h2>Research Overview</h2>
            <p>Disruptive mutations in the gene <em>CHD8</em> (<em><u>C</u>hromodomain <u>H</u>elicase
            <u>D</u>NA-binding protein <u>8</u></em>) are highly associated with risk of
            autism spectrum disorder (ASD). <em>CHD8</em> affects DNA accessibility of
            gene promoters by remodeling chromatin. Additionally, <em>CHD8</em>
            regulates expression of ASD risk-associated networks during neurodevelopment, and disruption
            of <em>CHD8</em> function can alter expression of the genes in these
            networks. While <em>CHD8</em> function has been largely studied in
            the cortex, its role in other brain structures, namely the basal
            ganglia, has been largely unexplored. Our research aims to
            characterize the molecular and circuit-level changes associated with
            loss of <em>CHD8</em> function. Specifically, we are interested to
            understand how loss of <em>CHD8</em> affects the genes, cell types, and
            regulatory networks critical for dopamine (DA) function in the basal
            ganglia.</p>

                <h3>Determine genomic regions and cell types of DA systems
                altered by loss of <em>CHD8</em></h3>
                <p>We aim to identify the effects of <em>Chd8</em> reduction
                on cell types and lineages in the developing mouse basal
                ganglia. Using snRNAseq and snATACseq analysis in embryonic and
                postnatal developmental timepoints, we are determining the genome-wide expression and epigenetic profiles that define the
                striatal and ventral midbrain cell populations in WT and
                <em>Chd8</em><sup>+/-</sup> mice.</p>

                <h3>Generate chromatin maps of DA circuit cell types to
                assess DA pathways regulated by <em>CHD8</em></h3>
                <p>We are using an <i>in vivo</i> inducible biotinylation system
                to map the <em>CHD8</em> regulatory networks at cellular
                resolution. We have generated a <em>Chd8</em>-tag mouse line in
                which a FLAG-Avi epitope is incorporated at the 3' end of the
                endogenous <em>Chd8</em> gene to encode a Chd8-tag protein.
                Activation of biotin ligase BirA using cell type specific Cre
                drivers of the developing DA system will biotinylate Chd8-tag
                only in those cell types. Biotin-streptavidin pulldowns followed
                by bioChIPseq allows us to map Chd8 binding targets at cellular
                resolution. We are also performing conventional RNAseq and
                ChIPseq by isolating cells expressing GFP activated by the same
                Cre drivers to further define the transcriptional and epigenetic
                state of the cells used in bioChIPseq.</p>
