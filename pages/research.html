                    to methyl groups on histones">  
                    <p>Disruptive mutations in the gene <strong><em>CHD8</em></strong> (<b><em><u>C</u>hromodomain <u>H</u>elicase
                    <u>D</u>NA-binding protein <u>8</u></em></b>) are highly
                    associated with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder
                    (ASD) and other neurodevelopmental disorders. These changes
                    often result in the loss of one copy of <i>CHD8</i>, so that
                    there is less <i>CHD8</i> protein expression in developing
                    tissues such as the neocortex.</p>
                    <p><i>CHD8</i> binds to histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyl
                    groups and remodels (or moves) nucleosomes along the DNA. By
                    changing the accessibility of genomic regions, important
                    regulatory regions may be revealed, such as transcription
                    factor binding sites (TFBS) at promoter sites. We have
                    performed chromatin-immunopreciptation assays to determine
                    the localization of <i>CHD8</i> in neural stem cells, mouse
                    cortex, and prenatal human brain, and find that <i>CHD8</i>
                    binds most often to promoter regions of active genes.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, we found that <i>CHD8</i> regulates the expression of other ASD risk-associated genes during neurodevelopment, and that these genes are co-expressed in ASD risk-associated co-expression networks. Disruption of <i>CHD8</i> function can therefore alter the expression of the genes in these networks. Our research aims to characterize the molecular and circuit-level changes associated with loss of <i>CHD8</i> function. Specifically, we seek to understand how loss of <i>CHD8</i> affects genes, cell types, and regulatory networks critical for neurodevelopment.</p>

                        <p>Some human patients with ASD who carry a CHD8 mutation have
                        a history of seizures or abnormal EEG, but this
                        interaction is not well characterized in humans or model
                        systems. Seizure susceptibility increases with age in some <i>Chd8</i><sup>+/-</sup> mice. Additionally,
                        male mice have higher seizure incidence than females. These seizures
                        in mice are characterized by behaviors such as
                        immobility, staring spells,
                        myoclonic jerks, and Straub tail sign. What is the brain
                        region/circuit responsible for these seizures? Moreover,
                        what are the sex-specific differences? Identifying the

                        understanding the etiology of the seizure phenotype seen
                        in human patients with damaging <i>CHD8</i> mutations.</p>
