                    <p>Disruptive mutations in the gene <strong><em>CHD8</em></strong> (<b><em><u>C</u>hromodomain <u>H</u>elicase
                    <u>D</u>NA-binding protein <u>8</u></em></b>) are highly associated with risk of
                    autism spectrum disorder (ASD)â€”more than a dozen damaging mutations
                    have been identified in <i>CHD8</i> from unrelated individuals
                    diagnosed with ASD. <i>CHD8</i> changes DNA accessibility of
                    gene promoters or transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) by
                    binding to histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyl groups and remodeling
                    nucleosomes. Additionally, <i>CHD8</i>
                    regulates expression of ASD risk-associated networks during neurodevelopment, and disruption
                    of <i>CHD8</i> function can alter expression of the genes in these
                    networks. The <i>CHD8</i> target genes involved in
                    these networks have been identified via high-throughput sequencing in cross species samples
                    such as human neural stem cells, human mid-fetal brain, and
                    embryonic mouse cortex. While <i>CHD8</i> function has been largely studied in
                    the cortex, its role in other brain structures has been largely unexplored. Our research aims to
                    characterize the molecular and circuit-level changes associated with
                    loss of <i>CHD8</i> function. Specifically, we are interested to
                    understand how loss of <i>CHD8</i> affects genes, cell types, and
                    regulatory networks critical for neurodevelopment.</p>

                        <p>Some patients with ASD who carry a CHD8 mutation have
                        a history of seizures or abnormal EEG, but this
                        interaction is not well characterized in humans or model
                        systems. Seizure susceptibility increases with age in some <i>Chd8</i><sup>+/-</sup> mice. Additionally,
                        male mice have higher seizure incidence than females. These seizures
                        in mice are characterized by behaviors such as immobility, drooling,
                        myoclonic jerks, and Straub tail sign. What is the brain
                        region/circuit responsible for these seizures? Moreover,
                        what are the sex-specific differences? Identifying the
                        abnormal brain activity in our <i>Chd8</i><sup>+/-</sup> mice can help with
                        understanding the etiology of the seizure phenotype seen
                        in human patients with damaging <i>CHD8</i> mutations.</p>
