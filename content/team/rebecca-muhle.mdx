Dr. Muhle earned her medical and graduate degrees from the Medical Scientist Training Program at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and completed her adult psychiatry residency and child & adolescent fellowship training within the Solnit Integrated Adult and Child & Adolescent Psychiatry Research Training Program at the Yale University Child Study Center. Dr. Muhle's scientific research aims to uncover molecular genetic pathways that increase the likelihood of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, by utilizing high-throughput genomics methods in mouse and human model systems to examine the effects of disruptions of implicated genes. She is a board-certified general and child & adolescent psychiatrist. When not in the clinic or the lab, she enjoys concerts, playing fetch with the dog and "fishing" with the cat.
