The Muhle Lab attends Barnard College's 2023 Summer Research Institute.

Our undergraduate researcher, Arrine Hoque, presented her summer research poster entitled "Assessing Autism-like Behavioral Phenotypes in Male Mice Heterozygous for Autism Risk Gene *CHD8*". Arrine worked with Sam Dhanani to employ various mouse behavior assays to further investigate the behavior phenotype of our *Chd8*+/- mice.

Congrats to Arrine and Sam for their work on this project!
