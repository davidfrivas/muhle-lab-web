Members of the Muhle Lab bid farewell to Yun-Kyung on her last day in the lab!

Yun-Kyung is moving on to pursue her medical studies at Wright State University Boonshoft School of Medicine. The Muhle Lab celebrated her accomplishments with lunch at Fort Washington Public House Restaurant.

Yun-Kyung has been working with our lab for 2 years. During her time here, she studied the molecular biology of *Chd8* haploinsufficiency in mice. Additionally, she performed a comprehensive medical literature review of the association of likely damaging human CHD8 mutations with seizures and abnormal EEG.

The Muhle Lab wishes Yun-Kyung the best of luck on her journey in medical school!
