Muhle Lab attends the 2023 International Society for Autism Research (INSAR) meeting in Stockholm, Sweden. The annual INSAR meeting hosts autism researchers and trainees from around the world to present their progress in autism research.

David Rivas gave an oral presentation entitled "*Chd8* Happloinsufficient Mice Exhibit Reduced Novelty Induced Hyperactivity and Decreased Exploratory Behavior" for the *CHD8* session panel.

While in Stockholm, our lab explored some tourist attractions such as Stockholm City Hall, The Royal Palace, The Nobel Prize Museum, and the Vasa Museum. In celebration of attending INSAR, Dr. Muhle invited her lab to have dinner at Aifur, a Viking-themed restaurant in Gamla stan.
