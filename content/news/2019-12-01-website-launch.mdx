Welcome to the official website of the Muhle Lab at Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute!

Our lab focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with a particular emphasis on the role of the *CHD8* gene in neurodevelopment. We use a combination of mouse models, human neural stem cells, and advanced genomic techniques to investigate how mutations in ASD risk genes affect brain development and function.

Please explore our site to learn more about our research, meet our team members, and stay updated with our latest news and publications.
