Previous research conducted with the Noonan lab found regional expression of *Chd8* is dynamic with embryonic age in mice. The uniform expression across the neocortex at E12.5 gives way to increasingly regionalized expression in the mature neurons of the developing mouse cortex, including cells of the cortical plate, the subplate, and the mantle zone. We are employing single cell analysis in developmental timepoints spanning corticogenesis, using a heterozygous *Chd8*<sup>+/-</sup> mouse line to determine the genome-wide expression and epigenetic profiles that define distinct brain cell populations in the context of *Chd8* loss. Additionally, we are examining a role for *Chd8* in non-cortical brain structures.
