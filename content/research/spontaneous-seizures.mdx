Some people who carry a *CHD8* mutation have a history of seizures or abnormal EEG, but this potential co-morbidity is not well characterized in human cohorts or model systems. We have found that seizure susceptibility increases with age in *Chd8*<sup>+/-</sup> mice. What are the brain regions and circuits responsible for these seizures? Identifying molecular markers preceding abnormal brain activity in our *Chd8*<sup>+/-</sup> mice may help to understand the etiology and progression of the seizure phenotype seen in patients with damaging *CHD8* mutations.
