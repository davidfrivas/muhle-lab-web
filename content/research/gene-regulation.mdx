We have generated a transgenic *Chd8*-Avi-tagged mouse line that allows for cell-type specific biotinylation by a Cre-activated biotin ligase, BirA. We are performing streptavidin-mediated ChIP-seq (bioChIP-seq) in tissues expressing activated BirA in cell-types of interest using Cre driver lines to target biotinylation. This will generate chromatin maps of distinct cell types to assess genes and biological pathways regulated by *Chd8*.
