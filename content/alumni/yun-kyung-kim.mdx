During her time in the lab, Yun-Kyung studied the molecular biology of *Chd8* haploinsufficiency in mice. She employed techniques such as chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, qRT-PCR analysis, and western blotting. Additionally, she performed a comprehensive medical literature review of the association of likely damaging human *CHD8* mutations with seizures and abnormal EEG. Yun-Kyung is currently a medical student at Wright State University Boonshoft School of Medicine.
