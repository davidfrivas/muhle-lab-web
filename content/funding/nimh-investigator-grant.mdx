The overall objective of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms whereby *CHD8* genetic mutations affect cells and pathways critical for core symptoms of ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders, by integrating state-of-the-art single nuclear transcriptomics and cell type specific functional genomics with electrophysiologic and behavioral probing of animal models with a loss of *CHD8* expression.
