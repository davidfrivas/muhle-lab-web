    content: "Disruptive mutations in the gene ***CHD8*** (***C**hromodomain **H**elicase **D**NA-binding protein **8***) are highly associated with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other neurodevelopmental disorders. These changes often result in the disruption of one copy of *CHD8*, leading to less *CHD8* protein expression in developing tissues such as the neocortex."

    content: "*CHD8* binds to histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyl groups and remodels (or moves) nucleosomes along the DNA. By changing the accessibility of genomic regions, important regulatory regions may be revealed, such as transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) at promoter sites. In prior studies with the Noonan lab at Yale University, we performed chromatin-immunopreciptation assays followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), to determine the localization of *CHD8* in neural stem cells, mouse cortex, and prenatal human brain. We found that *CHD8* binds most often to promoter regions of active genes. *CHD8* consistently bound gene targets across samples, including human neural stem cells (hNSCs), mouse cortex, and prenatal human brain."

    content: "Additionally, we found that *CHD8* regulates the expression of other genes associated with the likelihood of autism during neurodevelopment, and that these genes are co-expressed in networks that are also associated with likelihood of autism. Disruption of *CHD8* function may therefore alter the expression of the genes in these networks. Our research aims to characterize the molecular and circuit-level changes associated with loss of *CHD8* function. Specifically, we seek to understand how loss of *CHD8* affects genes, cell types, and regulatory networks critical for neurodevelopment."
